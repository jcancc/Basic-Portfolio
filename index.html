        <img src="assets/images/profile image.jpeg" alt="ProfileImage">
        <p>Hello World! Let's see, a little about myself... I'm a doggy. I don't know what I'm doing. But I love long
            walks on the beach, playing fetch, and occasionally rolling around in/eating poop. If you'd like to know
            more please peruse the links above!</p>
        <p>And now a quote from A. Huxley, "A child-like man is not a man whose development has been arrested; on the
            contrary, he is a man who has given himself a chance of continuing to develop long after most adults have
            muffled themselves in the cocoon of middle-aged habit and convention."

        <p>Nice quote huh?</p>
